# Gradient-Boosting-Classification
Gradient Boosting Classification is a highly effective ensemble learning method that sequentially builds decision trees to correct errors made by previous models in the ensemble. By focusing on instances where earlier models performed poorly, it iteratively improves prediction accuracy.
