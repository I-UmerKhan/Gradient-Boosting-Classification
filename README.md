# Gradient-Boosting-Classification
Gradient Boosting Classification is a highly effective ensemble learning method that sequentially builds decision trees to correct errors made by previous models in the ensemble. By focusing on instances where earlier models performed poorly, it iteratively improves prediction accuracy. This technique is particularly useful in handling complex relationships and capturing interactions between features in the data, making it suitable for both structured and unstructured datasets. Gradient Boosting Classification not only enhances model accuracy but also reduces bias and variance by combining multiple weak learners into a strong predictive model. It provides valuable insights into feature importance, aiding in feature selection and understanding the impact of different variables on predictions. Its versatility allows it to be applied across various machine learning tasks, including classification and regression, making it a favored choice in scenarios where high predictive performance is essential.
